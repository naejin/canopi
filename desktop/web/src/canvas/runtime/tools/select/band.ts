// Owns Select's band: a press on empty ground clears the selection unless the
// press is additive, and the drag draws a screen-aligned box from the press to the pointer (the band's `quad` draft:
// the selection stroke at 2 px over the selection fill). The release selects every object the box touches, tested
// against its world quad (turned with the view, never widened to its world box; spec §4.9), the locked ones left out,
// added to the selection when the press was additive, never removed from it (an Alt band adds what it touches). Only a
// drag makes a band, whatever its size: the recogniser's slop tells it from a click (A9). The release runs when the
// scene is settled (CanvasTool.settledRelease).
