// Owns the ToolHost's grid snapping, on true east and north (world axes, user), whatever the bearing: on a turned map
// the lattice turns with the map (spec §4.6). The interval comes from the frame's pixelsPerMetre (the plane origin's
// scale, which the bearing does not change). The host feeds ToolPoint.free, ToolPoint.snapped and ToolContext.snap from
// here, and the length a Shift constraint keeps along its ray (snapAlongRay; spec §2.3: constrain, then snap).
// canvas/grid.ts keeps the arithmetic, which the drawn grid reads too, so the grid lines are the snap lattice.
