// map is attached, and again after a detach or a failure), the NavigationPolicy every driver on it reads, and the one frame stream
// readers subscribe to. The host relays the live driver's frames with its own revisions, so revisions and plane revisions stay
// monotonic across swaps, and marks them attached while an attached driver is live.
