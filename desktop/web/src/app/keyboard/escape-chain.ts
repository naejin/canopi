// 8; in capture while a drag or nudge series is live, step 4) and prevents and stops a key a layer took. Popovers

// pipeline, so the canvas gesture layer cannot see it; fixture I9), the raster inspection at 25 while inspecting; the
// canvas port's layers register here, since the runtime never imports app code, from the key router's install.
