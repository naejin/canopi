// Follow mode's camera half (canopi-f47t.53; design check A3; U54 Q13–Q15, Q17, Q12). Following centres the camera on
// each fix through the view's showPlace jump, the one camera writer's command (ADR 0016; MapLibre's GeolocateControl,
// which calls fitBounds itself, is reference only, A2). The click holds the camera where it is: that jump stops a flight
// still under way (a saved view, a place), whose landing would otherwise read as a move. Any other move ends follow,
// from the click on: the settled camera is compared with the camera at the click until the first jump, then with each
// jump's read-back, and the live camera again on each fix before jumping, with a tolerance of about one pixel on the
// ground (lon/lat), so a re-origin, which moves the session plane and not the ground, keeps following. A Design
// activation and the start of a story presentation end it explicitly. The session (session.ts) owns the mode.
