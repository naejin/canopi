// app/lidar/sampler.ts
//
// The one way the frontend samples site data (canopi-f47t.42, spec §1.10; architecture review finding 3; stream C builds
// it): row values (lane 'values', from site-values.ts) and the profile (lane 'profile', from profile.ts) both ask here, and
// nothing else calls `lidarSamplePoints`. Its rules:
// - one invoke in flight per lane; the backend serialises sampling across lanes (one permit before its Local slot);
// - a request's targets are split, in list order, into batches of LIDAR_SAMPLE_MAX_TARGETS, each with every point
//   (at most LIDAR_SAMPLE_MAX_POINTS), sent one after another;
// - a newer key replaces the lane's queued key, but never cuts short the running key's remaining batches, so a row past
//   the first batch gets its value while the pointer moves;
// - an answer is published only while the Design session it was asked for (at `request`, not when it runs) is open, and
//   a key whose session closed while it was queued never runs; each target names the generation it expects, so a moved
//   head answers Unavailable rather than newer data;
// - a failed batch rejects its request; the lane goes on with its queued key.
