// Owns the ranges Cut outliers draws (canopi-f47t.42, spec §1.10 "Open item"): the 2–98 % range of one displayed
// generation, read once per display key from its display COGs in the shared raster worker lanes (`pool.ts`). One asset
// uses cog-tiler's own percentiles; a mosaic takes the same 2–98 % points (GeoLibre's `autoRangeFor` rule) of the
// distribution the map draws (`mosaicRange`): each asset counts for the ground it shows by its bounds, so a small part
// read at a finer overview does not outweigh a large one, a member higher ones hide entirely is not read, and one they
// hide in part counts for its visible share. Never stored: a reopened Design reads it again. Until it lands, or when it
// cannot be read, the entry draws its data range. An asset whose read fails (a lane restart, an asset error) is read
// again up to `READ_ATTEMPTS` times; past that the key keeps its data range until the store resets (a new generation is
// a new key), since the display effect asks again on every Design edit and would reread the whole mosaic each time.
