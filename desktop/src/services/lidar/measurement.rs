//! Sampled process-tree resident memory for the representative raster runs.
//!
//! The combined-memory gate needs the working set that is actually live while a
//! raster operation runs, including the GDAL children the engine launches. This
//! module samples the root process and every descendant it can observe on a
//! fixed interval, tracking `(pid, start time)` identity so a recycled pid is
//! never counted twice and a child that exits between discovery and read is
//! reported as an unreadable sample rather than as zero.
//!
//! Reported limitations, which every gate must state:
//!
//! - Sampling can miss peaks shorter than the interval; the value is a lower
//!   bound on the true peak, never an upper bound.
//! - Summing resident sets double-counts pages shared between the root and its
//!   children (copy-on-write, shared libraries, page cache), so the total is
//!   conservative.
//! - A tick with an unreadable member is counted as incomplete; incomplete
//!   ticks are not evidence of a pass.
//!
//! Only Linux `/proc` is implemented. Other platforms report
//! [`TreeMeasurement::Unsupported`], which callers must treat as unavailable
//! rather than as a passing measurement.
