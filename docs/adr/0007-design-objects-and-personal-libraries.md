# Design groups, symbols and saved stamps

Status: Accepted (2026-09-25, Canopi v2)

## Context

Design objects carry presentation and grouping choices that must survive editing, printing and reuse. Users also keep personal libraries (saved object stamps, the Design Notebook) that are not part of any one Design.

## Decision

- **Object groups** are flat, typed collections of concrete design objects that may span the Plants, Zones and Annotations layers. Groups have no nesting and no group-level layer, position or rotation; visibility, editability, geometry and membership derive from typed members. Members are referenced by typed ids so plant, zone and annotation ids cannot collide.
- **Plant symbols** are a fixed built-in set stored as ids in the Design: canopy, conifer, palm, shrub, herb, grass, bamboo, fern, climber, groundcover, rosette and cactus, plus the abstract `round` (neutral fallback), square, triangle and cross. Unknown ids use the fallback. Symbols are user-chosen, scene-owned presentation, independent of catalog taxonomy. Native contour data feeds the picker, renderer, stamps and PDF without runtime SVG parsing or image textures.
- **Plant presentation** has one path: symbolic markers sized by the visual footprint curve and local spacing, coloured by explicit plant colour, species colour or stratum fallback, decorated by symbol. Automatic detail and the inspection lens are transient reading aids that never change the Design. Pinned plant names are persisted and win over automatic names.
- **Shaped zones keep their kind.** Rotating rectangular and elliptical zones stores an explicit orientation (degrees clockwise from true north) instead of converting them to polygons.
- **Saved object stamps** are a personal library, not part of `.canopi` Designs. Desktop stores them in the user DB and can import or export one stamp as a `.canopi` file holding only its visible objects; this never goes through Design Session open/save or Recent Designs and never carries Budget, Timeline, Consortiums or hidden metadata. Web keeps stamps browser-local without import/export. Stamps are relative arrangements in metres.
- **Design Notebook** (Desktop only) is a personal library of saved Design references in one sectioned ledger with manual order, stored in the user DB. Switching Designs from it uses the normal Design replacement flow; each `.canopi` file stays the authority for its content and name.

## Consequences

- Groups, symbols and stamps work identically on the map canvas and in PDF.
- Stamp and Notebook data never leak into shared Design files.
- General "display by / colour by" modes need a new decision.
