# Frontend

## Purpose

Boundaries of the Preact frontend in `desktop/web/src/`. Related: [design system](../../.interface-design/system.md), [editions](editions.md), [design document](design-document.md), [map workspace](map-workspace.md).

## Authorities and boundaries

- Stack and directory map: [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md). `generated/` is bindings output and never hand-edited.
- Import direction: components → actions/controllers/workbenches → Design Edit or state. Canvas edits go through runtime commands on `currentCanvasSession` (`canvas/session.ts`); non-canvas Design edits through `app/design-edit/`; panels read canvas entities through read-only runtime queries. A view never mirrors an authority's state to restyle it.
- Commands: `commands/registry.ts` is the one public seam over `commands/graph/`. `app/shell-commands/index.ts` owns neutral ids, label keys and shortcut matching; `app/shell-commands/menus.ts` (`composeWorkspaceMenus`) is the one menu model for the menubar, the compact Menu button, the palette and the F1 dialog; `app/workspace-commands/` holds the capabilities and canvas intents both editions share.
- Shortcuts: `shortcuts/manager.ts` (Desktop) and `web/canvas-shortcuts.ts` (Web) route keys in one order: the plant finder's Ctrl F (`app/plant-finder/focus.ts`), a Stories Undo toast (`app/stories/actions.ts`), then the command graph; each stands down while the modal layer is held or the key is `defaultPrevented`. Esc belongs to the map's Esc chain and is shown as a `keyHint` only. `app/shell-commands/shortcut-text.ts` localizes canonical strings (`Ctrl+Shift+Z`) and derives `aria-keyshortcuts`.
- Modal layer: `app/shell/modal-layer.ts` is the one owner. A dialog (the command palette included) holds it through `useModalLayer()`; chrome registered with `useModalInertRegion` becomes `inert`; menus and key routing stand down. `app/shell/focus-regions.ts` owns F6 / Shift F6 between title bar, tool rail, map and open panel.
- Visible map area: chrome registers through `components/shared/useMapChrome.ts`; `app/shell/visible-map-area.ts` derives the frame the camera fits into, the `--map-inset-*` properties, each rail's room and whether credits fold. Both rails fold through `components/shared/rail-fit.ts`.
- Workspace frame: `components/workspace/WorkspaceComposition.tsx` owns primary/side routing, the dock, the phone sheet and the shared dialogs, and validates registered surfaces against the shell projection, so command capabilities decide which panels exist.
- Plant finder: every plant list uses `components/shared/PlantFinder.tsx` over `app/plant-finder/`. `matcher.ts` is pure; `quick-filters.ts` gives Stratum (the Design's) and Form (catalog habit) filters; `map-matches.ts` rings matches only for Plants in this Design through a highlight channel that never selects or dirties. The catalog searches through the workbench's FTS, not the matcher.
- Resource ownership: every runtime, renderer, MapLibre instance, timer, listener, worker and DOM overlay has one lifecycle owner. Application-lifetime owners are installed by `platform/desktop.ts` and `platform/browser.ts` with stored disposers; module-level `effect()` calls dispose under `import.meta.hot.dispose()`.

## Rules

FAP = `__tests__/frontend-architecture-policies.test.ts`, policies named as quoted.

- `components/**` never imports `ipc/**` or `@tauri-apps/**`; `app/**` never imports `components/**` (FAP "Components reach native capabilities through app actions", "App modules do not import components").
- `ipc/**` imports nothing from `app/**` but the types of a port it implements; gates and encoders stay app-side (FAP "IPC transports import nothing from app"; `ipc/design.ts` excepted until canopi-m4v0).
- `app/*/controller.ts` modules are leaves; cross-concern orchestration lives in workflow modules with `installX()` / `disposeX()` (FAP "App controllers stay leaves").
- Command consumers read the registry and its projections, never `commands/graph/**` or canvas state (FAP "Command consumers do not bypass the registry", "Command consumers do not bypass their projections", "Tool Rail renders its projection without reading Canvas state", "Menu Bar renders the shared workspace menu model").
- The right-click menu runs only its request's scene-edit commands (FAP "The right-click menu runs only its request’s scene edits"; `canvas-context-menu-entries.test.ts`).
- Every command with a shortcut appears in File, Edit, View, Tools or Help with that shortcut; Single-key shortcuts off drops character-key shortcuts from routing, rails, menus and F1 together (`commands-registry.test.ts`, `web-canvas-shortcuts.test.ts`).
- While a modal dialog holds the layer, chrome is inert, the menubar opens nothing and `handleAppCommandKeyDown` does nothing (`modal-layer.test.tsx`). F6 cycles the four regions and returns focus (`focus-regions.test.ts`).
- The visible map frame and rail room follow the registered chrome; a rail folds its last entries into More before covering chrome (`visible-map-area.test.tsx`, `tool-rail.test.tsx`, `panel-rail.test.tsx`).
- The matcher depends only on `utils/species-search-normalization.ts` (FAP "Plant finder matcher stays pure over the search normalization authority"; `plant-finder-matcher.test.ts`, `plant-finder-quick-filters.test.ts`).
- Species Catalog UI consumes `speciesCatalogWorkbench`, never a storage engine; Web species detail stays behind the reduced adapter (FAP "Species Catalog UI consumes the public Workbench", "Web Species detail stays behind the reduced adapter"). See [species catalog](species-catalog.md).
- Planning panels read `app/planning-projection/` and write through their workbench and Design Edit (FAP "Planning surfaces do not read Canvas or document authorities directly", "Non-canvas Design writers consume Design Edit").
- `canvas/runtime/**` never imports `i18n` or settings; it receives them through `CanvasRuntimeAppAdapter` (FAP "Canvas Runtime translations and settings stay behind the App Adapter").
- Every user-visible string goes through `t()` and exists in all 11 locales (`i18n-completeness.test.ts`); English is sentence case and placeholders fit their field (`i18n-copy.test.ts`); plant symbol names exist per id in every locale (`botanical-symbols.test.ts`). Terms follow the [UI glossary](ui-glossary.md).
- `t()` observes `locale`; components read `locale.value` only to pick localized data or format dates. A species without a name in the interface language shows its English name with the localized mark through `SpeciesIdentity` (`components/shared/SpeciesIdentity.tsx`) (advice).
- CSS Modules use the spacing, type, radius and transition tokens or an exact exception with a reason (`css-module-policies.test.ts`). Colour tokens instead of raw `rgba()`, and weights 400/600 only (advice).
- Signals: `useSignalEffect` in components, never `signal.value` in a `useEffect` dependency array; `.peek()` for non-dependencies; `batch()` for multi-signal writes; no per-frame unconditional signal writes (advice). Pointer gestures go through `usePointerResize` / `usePointerReorder` (FAP "Panel resize surfaces delegate pointer lifecycle ownership").
- Tests: write the failing behavioural test first at the command or interaction boundary with real focus, keyboard and pointer events. Suites live in `__tests__/` as `*.test.ts(x)`; colocated tests under `src/` also run. An unhandled error fails the run. `npm run test:coverage` enforces the floors in `vite.config.ts`.

## Do not

- Do not import Tauri, IPC or MapLibre from a component (FAP "Production app and components do not import MapLibre directly").
- Do not weaken or exempt a policy to pass; reproduce a suspect parser failure in `architecture-harness.test.ts` first.
- Do not route Esc to a command; the map's Esc chain owns it.
- Do not mount a dialog inside an inert region, or use `window.prompt()`, `confirm()` or `alert()` (WebView blocks them).
- Do not use a native `<select>` or `<input type="date">`; use `Dropdown` and `DatePicker`, never wrapped in a native `label`.
- Do not use `title` on icon-only buttons (`ButtonTooltip` and an `aria-label`), or load fonts from a CDN (`@fontsource` through `styles/fonts.css`).
- Do not mock `i18n` without a reason (partial mocks spread `importOriginal`), or retire a locale key in fewer than all 11 files.
- Do not parse optional numeric input with `parseFloat(v) || 0`; use `Number.isFinite(x) && x >= 0`.
