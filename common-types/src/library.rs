//! Typed library items, analysis requests and provenance (ADR 0011).
//!
//! Every Data Library item has a role (imported source or derived result) and
//! an item type; layers, legends and value readouts dispatch on the type and
//! nothing assumes an elevation raster. A derived item records what produced
//! it: its analysis, recipe version, inputs and their generations, parameters
//! and the tool that ran. The analyses themselves are declared in the authored
//! `common-types/analysis-registry.json`, generated into Rust and TypeScript.
